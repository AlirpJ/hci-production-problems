## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=1030u0kAfnhpBvhvSsmHriNPhdh
Your Rationale: Here we have a bold red color palette. The reason for this is because this new gaming console intends to pop out in advertisments, stores, and the homes of friends of gamers, making this a popular purchase. Also, red will reflect the passion and energy gamers have, as well as the fire and drive for the current popular games that involve competition and fighting online. It is a bold move to bring out a new gaming console in the current market where PC, Xbox, and Playstation are all solid options, so the powerful red will definitely give a good fight. Additionally, China itself also has a big tech consumer market, so red being a symbol of prosperity is an added bonus. 

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52a0u0krpA4gVL5miEBySuv-mno
Your Rationale: This is a pastel yellow color palette! The bright and energizing yellow are supposed to invoke the feelings of refreshness that come with the hopeful spring months as we enter into a new year. The reason why we have tints by adding white is to create a pastel palette which makes the springtime tour announcements even more inviting, and a bit more of relaxing feeling to make sure the energetic yellow is not going overboard. 

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=34F150krDBvh4LPmuFM-gvdAcnP
Your Rationale: For this triadic palette, the three colors used are purple, orange-yellow, and green. Here we return to the pastel in order to create association for parents with their young children on the yellow. The orange-yellow is in between orange which (like purple) invokes creative thinking, and yellow, which as aforementioned relates to children. The softer tones created will also hopefully keep children calm, but they are not too lightly tinted in order to keep children engaged with presenting colors for the consistent color scheme throughout the app. A bit of green is caught for the association of growth, and purple for creativity. 

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=c4m4R023g0k-bkVnPzXIA7Qz1f4mZ5b
Your Rationale: The aim of this palette was to keep an educational, modern, and professional look. I looked at my own computer and peripherals to get some ideas. (I have a branded "gaming" monitor that is black with minor red accents) People interested in pursuing cybersecurity may be on the computer a lot and I assume that means they perfer darker shades (having tints give the impression of a brighter screen which doesn't feel good on the eyes after longer periods of computer usage). Outside of the red, cool colors are used to give a sense of professionalism.
